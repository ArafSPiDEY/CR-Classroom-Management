# CSE 2100 - Software Development Project I

I didn't know Java Swing at first because I skipped this lecture in 2nd semester. ðŸ˜œ
So, I fisrt made the app with terminal, like the assignment of 2nd semester. And then wanted to convert it to graphical interface. But alas, that wasn't as straight-forward. I had to make the app from almost scratch. ðŸ˜«

Still, this is a work of mine. So I'm gonna keep it here.
