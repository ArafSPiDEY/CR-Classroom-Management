# CSE 2100 - Software Development Project I

As I became a CR of our class in 2-1 semester, I noticed that many classe needed to shift their classes to another time or take extra classes or CT times at different times and different days. We, all CRs of all Series, use a Messenger Group to let others know each other's changed schedules. So, when many CRs take many slots in a day, it becomes quite difficult to keep track of which slot is taken and which is free.

So, I thought I can make an app in which this problem could be solved. My plan was to make an interactive app and give all other CRs access to the app, so that we can visually see which slot is free (much like ticket booking apps). But to enable multiple users, I needed to learn database and I wanted to use my knowledge from first year only. Therefore, I didn't do multiple users, rather just for me, locally.

But honestly, in the middle of the semester I realized that this problem could be solved with a Google Spreadsheet. ðŸ˜†

But still, I might upgrade this app to multiple users in future some day.

Maybe in Software Development Project II?
